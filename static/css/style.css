/*
    All custom CSS rules previously in this file have been removed.
    Their functionalities are now achieved through Tailwind CSS utility classes
    applied directly in the HTML templates. This includes:
    - .hidden (replaced by Tailwind's 'hidden' class)
    - Positional and z-index styles for PDF viewer components 
      (#pdfContainer, #pdfCanvas, #markerCanvas, #pdfStatus)
    - Z-indexing for #defectForm elements (no longer needed due to layout changes)

    This file is kept for any future custom CSS that cannot be easily managed
    by Tailwind CSS.
